userjs for [bgm.tv](https://bgm.tv)

## subject page power up

[former project](https://github.com/everpcpc/bgm_subject_members) by [everpcpc](https://github.com/everpcpc)

It has been much easier to get collecting process of friends by official filter since update on 20170222 so it seems we no longer need api built by self.

Thanks to the work by [everpcpc](https://github.com/everpcpc) and my script may take place of [his](https://github.com/bangumi/scripts/tree/master/everpcpc). Though we provide different experience of the similar, you can just choose the one you like.

It's preferred to use chrome because I have not test the performance on other browsers

## about folder failed

No longer useful script due to site update on 20170222 & 20170223

(It's foolish to try to compete with [sai](https://github.com/Sai) in coding!)
